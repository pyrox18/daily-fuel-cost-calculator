# Daily Fuel Cost Calculator
Calculator for petrol station dealers to find out how much money they need to satisfy a fuel delivery.

This web application is accessible through the URL http://pyrox18.github.io/daily-fuel-cost-calculator.

Currently, the calculator is in a very primitive stage (as it is still very much a work in progress). Thus, expect the page to look sort of ugly and to have bugs. These issues will be rectified as the development of the application progresses.

The calculator currently utilises AngularJS, with future plans to switch to UI Bootstrap (https://angular-ui.github.io/bootstrap/) to facilitate better UI designs.
