# Daily Fuel Cost Calculator
Calculator for petrol station dealers to find out how much money they need to satisfy a fuel delivery.

This web application is accessible through the URL https://pyrox18.github.io/daily-fuel-cost-calculator.

Currently, a simple calculation mode is available for use. The calculator will provide feedback based on the bank account balance given, the fuel type (which dictates the fuel price per litre used), the fuel commission per litre given, and the amount of fuel to be received that is given. The results are updated on-the-fly as input is provided.

The standard and advanced modes are still being developed.

The calculator utilises Bootstrap (http://getbootstrap.com/) for the UI framework, and AngularJS (https://angularjs.org/) for the dynamic page elements.

Should there be any problems or bugs with the calculator, an issue can be opened to raise awareness on the problem. Kindly state the issue as clearly as possible to facilitate the debugging process.
