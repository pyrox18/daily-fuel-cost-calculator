      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>Daily Fuel Cost Calculator is a calculator that assists you to determine if you have enough funds in your bank account to receive a fuel delivery. The calculator is designed to work specifically with Malaysian units and fuel prices. There are three modes offered for use (Simple, Standard and Advanced). Each mode provides a different number of features which should cater any type of user, from the beginner to the experienced.</p>

      <h2>How do I use this calculator?</h2>
      <p>Simply pick one of the three modes provided, and provide the calculator with the needed input values!</p>

      <h2>But which mode should I use?</h2>
      <p>Each of the three modes will help you in different ways.</p>
      <p><b>Simple mode</b> is the easiest and quickest to use. Simply provide your current bank account balance, the fuel type you wish to calculate for, the commission you receive for the fuel and the amount of fuel you are receiving. As you type the values, the calculator will update accordingly in real-time - which means you don't have to click on any other buttons to get your result!</p>
      <p><b>Standard mode</b> extends on the simple mode's functionality by allowing you to calculate costs for up to three fuel types at once. In addition, you can provide the amounts of fuel that you will receive for different days, up to a total of 5 days. The calculator will automatically total the amount and cost for you and provide you with a sum for each fuel type.</p>
      <p><b>Advanced mode</b> has the most tools available for your usage. This mode takes everything that the standard mode has and adds a fourth fuel type for calculation, as well as new data fields, such as fuel tank capacity, ullage and balance, and estimated one-day sales to give you the most accurate representation of how much money you need in your bank account and how much space you need in your fuel tanks.
