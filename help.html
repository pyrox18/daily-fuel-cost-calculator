      <h2>Help</h2>
      <p>Daily Fuel Cost Calculator is a calculator that assists you to determine if you have enough funds in your bank account to receive a fuel delivery. There are three modes offered for use (Simple, Standard and Advanced). Each mode provides a different number of features which should cater any type of user, from the beginner to the experienced.</p>

      <h3>Simple Mode</h3>
      <p>Simple Mode can be accessed by clicking the "Simple" button near the top of the calculator.</p>
      <p>The upper half of the calculator displays your bank account balance after subtracting it with the cost of the fuel being delivered. The colour of the balance and subsequent message will change to indicate the sufficiency of your account funds to receive the fuel delivery.</p>
      <p>A summary of the following data is also presented:</p>
      <ul>
	<li>Your initial bank account balance</li>
	<li>The fuel price based on the fuel type selected</li>
	<li>The fuel cost per litre after subtracting commission</li>
	<li>The total amount and cost of the fuel being received</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These values will change according to the data you provide in the following section.</p>
      <p>Below the summary of data, there are 4 inputs that you need to provide.</p>
      <ul>
	<li>Your current bank account balance before the delivery of fuel</li>
	<li>The type of fuel you are receiving</li>
	<li>The commission received per litre of the fuel type sold</li>
	<li>The amount of fuel you are receiving</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The calculation of the data given is represented by the following algorithm.</p>
      <blockquote>
	<p><var>fuelCostPerLitre</var> = <var>fuelPricePerLitre</var> - <var>fuelCommissionPerLitre</var></p>
	<p><var>totalFuelReceivingCost</var> = <var>totalFuelReceivingAmount</var> * <var>fuelCostPerLitre</var></p>
      </blockquote>
